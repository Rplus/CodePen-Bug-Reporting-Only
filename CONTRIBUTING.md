This repo is for **bug reporting** on CodePen in public. You know: things that are broken. 

If you need *private* support, you can [get that here](http://codepen.dev/support/). You know, things like billing and accont specific questions.

Things like **opinions**, **wishes**, and **feedback** are better submitted to us via the [private support form](http://codepen.dev/support/). If you open those kinds of threads here, we will likely close them and triage them over to our side.
